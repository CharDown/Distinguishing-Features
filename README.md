# Distinguishing-Features
This is a game made in GameMaker as a collection of levels to showcase different distinguishing features. These mechanics will impact the gameplay of the level hugely and allow for very different gameplay opportunities. 
In this I also make use of a lot of GameMaker draw functions in order to create animated visuals alongside using physics to implement various different movement options
